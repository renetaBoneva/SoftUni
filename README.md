# Programming Basics with Java
In my introductory programming course, I delved into the basics of coding with Java. I learned about conditional statements, discovering how to effectively use them in my code. Additionally, I gained proficiency in writing and utilizing both 'for' and 'while' loops, and even explored the concept of nesting them. The course aimed to provide a lightweight introduction to programming, allowing me to determine whether coding resonated with me. Fortunately, I found myself falling in love with the world of programming.
